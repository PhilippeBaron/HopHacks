Lessons learned will be applicable to other areas of mechanical engineering and will be particularly helpful for Senior Design. We will analyze (reverse engineer) the tractor. For example, given the engine delivers 28 HP at the PTO, how big does the PTO shaft need to be? How big is it? Over/under designed? How was it manufactured? How else could it have been manufactured. What size engine delivers 28 Hp? What fuel consumption is needed? What cooling capacity is needed? Answering such questions will prepare students to ask appropriate questions in senior design. How big/strong do we need to make it? We will also have a functioning N-series tractor that will be ‘sabotaged’ each week for students to test their logic skills at diagnosing the cause of the malfunction.

157,EN58043001,Systems Pharmacology and Personalized Medicine,"We have moved beyond the 'one-size-fits-all' era of medicine. Individuals are different, their diseases are different, and their responses to drugs are different too. This variability is not just from person to person; heterogeneity is observed even between tumors within the same person, and between sites within the same tumor. These levels of variability among the human population must be accounted for to improve patient outcomes and the efficiency of clinical trials. Some of the ways in which this is being explored include: drugs are being developed hand-in-hand with the tests needed to determine whether or not they will be effective; tumor fragments excised from patients are being cultured in the lab for high-throughput testing of drugs and drug combinations; data-rich assays such as genomics and proteomics identify thousands of potentially significant differences between individuals; and computational models are being used to predict which therapies will work for which patients. This course will focus on the applications of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to simulating the effects of various drugs across a heterogeneous population of diseased individuals. Such computational approaches are needed to harness and leverage the vast amounts of data and provide insight into the key differences that determine drug responsiveness. These approaches can also explore the temporal dynamics of disease and treatment, and enable the modification of treatment during recovery.

Locomotion emerges from effective physical interaction with an environment; therefore, the ability to generate appropriate forces (besides sensing, control, and planning) is essential to successful locomotion. General principles and integration of knowledge from engineering, biology, and physics will be emphasized. Sample topics include: How can kangaroos hop faster and fleas jump higher than their muscles allow? Why do race walkers use a peculiar hip movement? How do animals inspire prosthetic feet that helped Blade Runner compete with abled athletes? Why do Boston Dynamics’ robots move so well in most modest environments, and why does it still fail in complex terrain? Why do horses walk at low speeds but run at higher speeds? Can T-Rex run or must they walk? Why do larger animals become more erect in their leg posture? Why can a mouse falling from a skyscraper walk away with little injury, but a horse will smash? How can our muscles serve as energy-saving springs, force transmitting struts, and even energy-damping brakes? Why do migrating birds fly in a V-formation? Do Speedo’s sharkskin swimsuits really reduce drag? Students from ME, Robotics, and other programs are all welcome. Freshmen and sophomores with sufficient physics background may take with instructor approval. Students should have a strong understanding of Newtonian mechanics.

261,EN58021801,Learning Salon,"The Learning Salon is a weekly forum in which we explore bridges and contentions in biological and artificial learning. Each week our guest helps us uncover core theories, assumptions, and questions that lurk underneath the overwhelming proliferation of approaches to studying learning and intelligence. Humans are often assumed to represent the apex of learning and cognition, and arguably achieving or surpassing human cognitive capacity is the goal of AI. And yet, dogs, rats, flies, and machines can also learn specific tasks, sometimes exceeding human performance. In The Learning Salon, we explore this conundrum by bringing together people with different philosophies, disciplinary backgrounds, and approaches. People at different stages of their careers or outside of academia altogether are equally welcome."
